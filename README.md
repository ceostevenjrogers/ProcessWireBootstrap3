ProcessWireBootstrap3
=====================

This a site profile for the ProcessWire 2.3+ CMS providing a nearly blank template with an included Bootstrap 3. It's kept simple and as slim as possible so it's a good start for new pages. 
- Includes Bootstrap 3 and a blank Installation
- Only basic fields and templates (used Somas blank profile)
- The navigation function from Joss S. Bootstrap 2.3 profile was modified for Bootstrap 3 and is included.
- Features the basic include('head.inc') principle from Ryans PW profile.

For further information, look at the [Bootstrap 3 documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) or ask at the  [ProcessWire forums](http://processwire.com/talk/).

Thanks to Philipp U. (soma) and the Bootstrap team.
